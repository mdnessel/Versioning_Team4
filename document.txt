I worked 50hr weeks, and slept for the majority of the summer. I did go to Kings island for a weekend, that was fun. Thats my summer in a nutshell.

I spent the majority of my summer working on small programming projects and spending time with family. I did visit Chicago for a weekend for the first time, which was an interesting experience.
